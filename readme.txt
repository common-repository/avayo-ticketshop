Avayo ticketshop Shortcode Plugin

== Description ==

This plugin enables you to easily publish your Avayo (e)ticketshop on your WordPress website. In order to use it you need a Avayo account. Start the signup for your ticketshop account at [Avayo](https://www.avayo.nl/aanmelden).

After signup up. Your ticketshop will be available at https://your-subdomain.avayo.nl. The plugin will ask you to enter and store your subdomain-name. After done that, the plugin will provide you a shortcode. Copy and publish it on any page you want. The shortcode will generate some html iframe code (calling your ticketshop at https://your-subdomain.avayo.nl) that will be injected into your page where the shortcode is placed. The iframe will automatically be resized to the height of the content inside the iframe.
